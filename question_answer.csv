"René Descartes was a philosopher from the 17th century who is often called the founder of western philosophy. Modern western philosophy is often in response to his writing.Descartes had a major impact on mathematics, especially in geometry. In the book Meditations on First Philosophy, he embarked on a philosophical exercise where one discards all beliefs in things that are not absolutely certain and then tries to establish what can be known only for sure.","What was Descartes' impact on mathematics?

"The idea of mind-body dualism is the idea that your mind is the essential element of who you are, and that part of you is somehow separate from your body.Once one has established that one exists, how do you know that anyone else does?

The cart was intrigued by the idea that there could be lifelike replicas of people that could even move in a similar fashion to how our bodies move. He wanted to formulate a test to determine if someone was an automatron or a true person. He came to the conclusion that perhaps the thing that differentiated otamatone from people is the tomaton can only react in particular predetermined fashions if you wanted to have an open-ended conversation with such a machine it was unlikely to be able to use human language.,"What does the cart want to do with his automatons?

"Some have argued that the best way to determine if someone is a human is to see if they can answer questions in a way that is not programmed.Another philosopher who grappled with the question about what constitutes intelligence was Alan Turing. He was instrumental in designing and using the first digital computers. His work during World War II helped the British break the German Enigma code. In his later life, he became interested in artificial intelligence.","What is the Turing Test?

"The idea for the Turing test was inspired by a party game called the imitation game. In the imitation game, two people would go out to different rooms in the house and other people would interact with them by sending them questions to answer. The people who were hidden away in the other rooms with type back their answers and the other players would have to guess just based on these papers and responses who was who.","Who is Alan Turing?

"The essence of the Turing test is the notion of passing for something that you are not in convincing other people that you're something other than who you truly are. This notion is quite tragic, as it comes from Alan Turing, who was gay and was convicted of a crime for having a relationship with another man. He was sentenced to chemical castration as an alternative to imprisonment.","What is tragic about the essence of the Turing test?

"The notion of strong versus weak AI is more of a philosophical quandary than one that's been integrated into mainstream artificial intelligence research.There is a podcast that recommends by lex fridman that discusses philosophical quandaries related to strong versus weak AI.Lex Fridman is a deep learning researcher at MIT. He is interested in the notion of artificial general intelligence, or how to build a system that is generally intelligent.This podcast is super fascinating and philosophically oriented. It is a good resource for anyone who is interested in the philosophical questions surrounding artificial intelligence.","What is the difference between strong and weak AI?
